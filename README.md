Hack The Box (HTB) is an online platform that offers cybersecurity training through hands-on practice.
It provides realistic hacking challenges, vulnerable machines, and labs where users can learn and improve their cybersecurity skills — ranging from beginner to professional levels.
On Hack The Box, you typically:
•	Attack and exploit machines, web applications, or services.
•	Solve challenges in different categories like Web, Pwn, Crypto, Forensics, and Reversing.
•	Capture flags (special tokens) by exploiting vulnerabilities.
•	Earn points, rank up, and build your cybersecurity profile.
"Under the Web" is a medium difficulty challenge on Hack the Box in the Pwn category (with a heavy Web Exploitation focus).
It is centered around the idea of exploring hidden vulnerabilities on a web server, particularly focusing on Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerabilities.
"Under the Web" is about exploring hidden server-side vulnerabilities, mainly through Local File Inclusion (LFI) attacks, to leak files, understand the backend, possibly gain remote execution, and finally retrieve the flag.
